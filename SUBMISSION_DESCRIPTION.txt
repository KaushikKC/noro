PREDICTX - DECENTRALIZED PREDICTION MARKET PLATFORM WITH AI-POWERED ANALYSIS

================================================================================
PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================

PredictX is a fully decentralized prediction market platform built on the Neo blockchain that leverages SpoonOS AI agents to provide intelligent market analysis and automated trading recommendations. The platform combines blockchain technology, decentralized storage (NeoFS), and advanced AI agents to create a sophisticated prediction market ecosystem where users can create markets, trade shares, and receive AI-powered insights.

================================================================================
WHAT WE BUILT
================================================================================

1. NEO BLOCKCHAIN SMART CONTRACT
   - Implemented a comprehensive Neo N3 smart contract (PredictXMarket.cs) that handles:
     * Market creation with questions, descriptions, categories, and resolve dates
     * Trading functionality for buying YES or NO shares using GAS tokens
     * Oracle integration for automated market resolution
     * Payout distribution to winning shareholders
     * Real-time probability calculations based on market activity
   - Contract features include proper access control, event emission, and secure token transfers
   - All market data and trading activity is stored on-chain for transparency

2. SPOONOS AI AGENT SYSTEM
   We built a sophisticated multi-agent system using SpoonOS SDK with three specialized agents:

   a) ANALYZER AGENT
      - Fetches scientific papers from PubMed and arXiv databases
      - Analyzes evidence from multiple sources
      - Generates probability predictions (0-1 scale) with confidence scores
      - Provides evidence summaries and source citations
      - Uses real APIs (no mock data) for scientific research

   b) TRADER AGENT
      - Takes analysis results from the Analyzer Agent
      - Fetches real-time market data from Neo blockchain
      - Calculates optimal stake using Kelly Criterion for risk management
      - Generates trade recommendations (BUY_YES or BUY_NO) with amounts
      - Considers market probability vs agent probability for arbitrage opportunities

   c) JUDGE AGENT
      - Aggregates multiple analyses for consensus building
      - Provides weighted probability estimates
      - Helps resolve conflicts between different agent predictions
      - Enhances overall system reliability

   d) ORCHESTRATOR
      - Coordinates all three agents in a pipeline
      - Manages the complete market analysis workflow
      - Handles error recovery and fallback mechanisms
      - Supports batch processing for multiple markets

3. NEOFS DECENTRALIZED STORAGE INTEGRATION
   - Integrated NeoFS for permanent, decentralized storage of market metadata
   - Markets are stored both on-chain (for trading) and in NeoFS (for rich metadata)
   - Uses spoon_ai.tools.neofs_tools for container and object management
   - Provides redundancy and censorship resistance

4. BACKEND API (FASTAPI)
   - RESTful API that bridges frontend, agents, and blockchain
   - Endpoints for:
     * Market creation and retrieval
     * Agent analysis triggering
     * Trade proposal generation
     * Real-time WebSocket connections for agent logs
   - Integrates with Neo RPC for blockchain interactions
   - SQLite database for fast market data retrieval
   - Handles transaction preparation for NeoLine wallet signing

5. FRONTEND (NEXT.JS)
   - Modern React-based user interface
   - Market browsing and detail pages
   - Real-time probability visualization with gauges
